# GPA Analysis and Performance Tracking

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze student GPA data, track performance trends across different sections, and generate reports based on student achievements and challenges. It categorizes students into two primary lists based on their grades and maintains records of their appearances on these lists.

## Functional Requirements
### 1. Student Performance Lists
Students will be classified into two categories based on their grades:
- **Good List**: Includes students who have received one or more **A** or **A-** grades.
- **Work List**: Includes students who have received one or more **D+, D, D-**, or **F** grades.

For each list, the following details should be recorded:
- **Student Name**
- **Section**

Software should also be able to find the GPA for different sections

### 2. Historical Tracking
- The system must track if a student has ever appeared on either the **Good List** or the **Work List** in past records.

## Required Installations
- Installation of matplotlib, scipy, & pyarrow required
